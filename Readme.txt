*This Game is currently unfinished. I am still testing some of the functions in the game

This game is a mostly text-based "unfolding" game. It's base mechanic
is the pressing of buttons that result in messages being displayed and
certain resource values being altered. It starts with only one button,
and gradually, as time passes, more buttons appear and the story starts to
unfold. A good example of how this game will look is the game "A Dark Room"
by Doublespeak games.
